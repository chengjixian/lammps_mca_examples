----- Description --------

This is an example of a coarse-grained simulation of membrane curvature
mediated by "flippases".  The curvature instability you see here caused
by an imbalance of lipids in the inner and outer leaflets.
That imbalance is maintained by "flippase" protein motors (red)
which pull lipids from one side of the membrane to the other. 
This simulation was carried out using the "molecular cellular automata"
extensions in LAMMPS together with moltemplate (moltemplate.org).

This example contains an implementation of the DPPC lipid bilayer described in:
"Tunable generic model for fluid bilayer membranes"
