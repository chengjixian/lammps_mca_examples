# This is a table describing the force between a recently captured lipid
# and the corresponding site of a "flippase" motor located on the opposite
# side of the membrane.  This force will pull the lipid from one side of
# the membrane to the other.
#    This is the only requirement.  The precise strength of the force does 
# not matter.  I just wanted to produce a force which is strong enough to pull 
# the lipid from one side of the membrane to the other quickly,
# WITHOUT ripping the lipid completley out of the membrane,
# or being forced to use an unreasonably small timestep
# (or an unreasonably high langevin damping parameter).
#    I found that using an ordinary harmonic spring (Energy = (k/2)*r^2
# tended to either generated a force which was too weak at small separations, r,
# or an enormous force at large separations (causing numerical instability).
# So I tried using a tabular potential, and I played with the force values
# (4th column) in the table by hand until the system was behaving reasonably.
#    Actually it is common that when making new bonds during a simulation (and
# also bonded angular interactions), the forces and energies will often jump
# discontinously. Care must be taken to make sure that the simulation is stable.
# Since the precise form of the interaction between lipid and flippase motor
# does not matter in this approximation, (only the outcome matters),
# we are free to choose whichever pulling force is convenient.
