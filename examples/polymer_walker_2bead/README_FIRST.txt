This directory contains an example of a coarse-grained 
circular polymer bonded to a "walker" a motor which
walks along the polymer in a directed fashion.

The commands which control how this is done are in the 
"moltemplate_files/transition_rules.lt" file.
(and also in the "system.in.transitions" file generated by moltemplate).
The explanation of these commands is in the README_DYNAMICS directory.

The commands which define the bond connectivity are also in the
"moltemplate_files" directory.  (The system.in.* and system.data files were
generated by moltemplate.  See documentation at https://moltemplate.org)

Instructions on how to build LAMMPS input files and
run a short simulation are provided in other README files.
